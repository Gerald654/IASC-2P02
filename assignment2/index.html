    <h1>The Cask of Amontillado</h1>
    <h2>Gerald Ananaba</h2>

    <p>Edgar Allan Poe's "The Cask of Amontillado" stands as a chilling testament 
        to the depths of human vengeance. Within the narrative, Montresor, the narrator,
         harbors a deep-seated grudge against Fortunato, driven by an unspecified insult. 
         The story unfolds during the carnival season in an unnamed Italian city, setting 
         the stage for a tale of deception, betrayal, and ultimate retribution. Montresor 
         lures Fortunato into the catacombs under the guise of tasting a rare wine, 
         Amontillado. However, his true intention is to exact a cruel and calculated 
         revenge upon his unsuspecting victim. </p>

    <p>In visualizing the text, two distinct approaches offer insights into the 
        psychological and narrative complexities of Poe's tale. The first visualization,
         rooted in "The Three Stages of Revenge" theory, employs a vertical progression 
         to illustrate Montresor's descent into darkness through the stages of 
         contemplation, planning, and execution. The first five terms, including "vowed," 
         "nature," "idea," "thought," and "revenge," symbolize Montresor's contemplation 
         of revenge, capturing the initial seeds of his sinister plot. This stage is marked
          by a yellow 3D sphere, reflecting growth and contemplation as Montresor reflects
           on the perceived slights inflicted by Fortunato.</p>
    <p>Transitioning to the planning stage, the next five terms, such as "encountered," "carnival," "vault," "nitre," and "cough," embody Montresor's meticulous planning as he formulates the details of his revenge. Represented by a orange 3D shape, symbolizing intellect and strategy, this stage highlights the calculated nature of Montresor's scheme as he lays the groundwork for Fortunato's demise. Finally, the last five terms, including "hesitated," "drink," "wine," "tier," and "masonry," signify the execution of Montresor's plan. Marked by a red 3D shape, representing passion and intensity, this stage culminates in the climactic moment as Montresor traps Fortunato in the catacombs and seals his fate. The transition of these 3D mesh colors from yellow, too orange, to red signifies the rise of Montresor’s emotions as the plot of his revenge progresses.</p>
    <p>The general layout of the first visualization goes from bottom to top with the bottom being the beginning of the text, and the bottom the end of the text. It also accurately displays the rise in emotions from Montresor as he carries out his plot for revenge.</p>

    <p>In contrast, the second visualization adopts a horizontal progression, mirroring the chronological order of events in the narrative. Here, the first two terms, "encountered”, “carnival", encapsulate the surface-level interactions between Montresor and Fortunato during the carnival festivities. Represented by the two terms and a blue 3D torus, symbolizing tranquility and trust, this stage captures the façade of friendship before the descent into darkness begins. Transitioning to the stage of suspicion, the two terms reflect Fortunato's escalating unease as he ventures deeper into the catacombs with Montresor. He continuously tries to convince himself Montresor is playing a trick on him as he cannot fathom the thought of a friend’s betrayal. This, backed by the fact Montresor suggested they both head back after hearing Fortunato’s coughs, playing a façade. Symbolized by a purple 3D torus blending stability with intensity, this stage marks the growing tension between the characters as Fortunato becomes increasingly wary of his surroundings.</p>
    <p>Finally, the last two terms, "masonry", “satisfied” embody the ultimate confrontation between Montresor and Fortunato in the depths of the catacombs. Represented by a black 3D shape symbolizing darkness and death, this stage encapsulates the ominous climax of the narrative as Fortunato meets his tragic end at the hands of the vengeful Montresor. Together, these visualizations offer a multifaceted exploration of Poe's narrative, capturing the progression of revenge, the intertwined descent into darkness, and the tragic culmination of deceit and betrayal.</p>
    <p>The second visualization is perceived from left to right. This symbolizes the decent into the catacombs as they both go down deep into the darkness of their faiths. </p>
    <p>Looking to the future, further enhancements to the visualizations could involve incorporating interactive elements such as much more complicated animations or tooltips to deepen engagement and facilitate exploration of the narrative themes and character dynamics. Additionally, experimenting with alternative shapes or visual metaphors could offer fresh perspectives on the text, enriching the audience's understanding and appreciation of Poe's masterful storytelling.</p>
